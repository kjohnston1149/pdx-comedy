2. Move into the project folder
3. Open index.html in the browser of your choice (we suggest Chrome)
4. Alternatively, if using Atom, run "$ apm install atom-live-server" in the command line and launch a live local server by using the short cut "ctrl-shift-3".  For more information, visit https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server.
5. To edit the SCSS files, run the command "$ sass --watch scss:css" in the command line.
