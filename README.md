#### _A refactoring of the ember-based Portland-Comedy project._

#### By _**Kevin Johnston**_

## Description

_This app is a basic html refactoring of the Ember.js project for Portland Comedy.  At the current time, it is uses Sass, Javascript, the Google Calendar API, and HTML._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repository at:
  * https://github.com/kjohnston1149/pdx-comedy
2. Move into the project folder
3. Open index.html in the browser of your choice (we suggest Chrome)
4. Alternatively, if using Atom, run "$ apm install atom-live-server" in the command line and launch a live local server by using the short cut "ctrl-shift-3".  For more information, visit https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server.
5. To edit the SCSS files, run the command "$ sass --watch scss:css" in the command line.

## Known Bugs

* If pop-ups are blocked on the site, the Google Calendar API cannot authorize the app on a computer.  This may be fixed with further manipulation of the API code.

* Currently requires user to use a Google Account to authorize API.  Cannot access the API if not logged into an account.

* API is returning twice as many events as the JS files specify.
